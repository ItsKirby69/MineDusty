***Sandbox only (for now)***
# MineDusty
This mod originates from an old project of mine. It brings life (literally) into Mindustry with various Trees, plants, and much more!
Showcases will be shown in the Mindustry discord's Modding forums.

Contact me thru discord `itsdakirby69` or create a issue here in github!

*Please note that everything is experimental and are subject to be changed/edited/removed.
You are guaranteed to find bugs, unfinished content and more!!1!*

Visit the **[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/1wTgcEBs/minedusty)** to see goals and planned features!

## Downloading the mod!
*//TODO*

Download the jar file manually in the `releases` tab, or just copy the repository's link to download it `directly in-game` when adding a new mod!
