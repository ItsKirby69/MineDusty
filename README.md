# MineDusty
A reboot of my old project. Mod is for experimental use. Hopefully this will actually be a cohesive mod. Contact me through Discord! `itsdakirby69`. Just make sure you let me know where you're coming from...

## Early Downloads Coming soon soon <3333

**_Please note that this mod is unfinished. Bugs are bound to happen and you'll likely find unfinished content!!_**

[Trello board added](https://trello.com/b/1wTgcEBs/minedusty) *i keep on forgetting to use this...*

When downloading the `minedusty.jar` file from the releases tab, make sure to put the file into your *mods folder*.
Alternativly, you can `copy the link` of this repository and use that to download the latest version of this mod *directly* from the game.
