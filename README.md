# MineDusty
This mod aims to add more life into the game (literally!). Adding trees, shrubs, plants, and new environments to explore! The new luscious planet will have you fight against nature and the Crux one again for a battle against the resourceful planet.

There is much more than just plants which you may find. The mod is undergoing a content and campaign update.

Showcases will be shown in the Mindustry discord's [Modding forums](https://discord.com/channels/391020510269669376/1395862844427210862)! Come over for frequent update announcements as well as for questions or issues related!
