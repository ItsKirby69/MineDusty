***Sandbox only (for now)***
# MineDusty
A reboot of an old project of mine! A nature styled mod that would focus on bringing life and immersion to Mindustry!

*Please note that everything is experimental and are subject to be changed/edited/removed.
You are guaranteed to find bugs, unfinished content and more!!1!*

## Updates when?
You can frequently check the repo for updates or `watch` it to get notifications!
For wanting to see the direction the mod is taking, look at the **[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/1wTgcEBs/minedusty)** (i promise to keep updating this!!1!).

## Downloading the mod!
*//TODO*

Download the jar file manually in the `releases` tab, or just copy the repository's link to download it `directly in-game` when added a new mod!

Enjoy
